# AWS-Serverless-Email-Marketing


AWS provides various serverless services that can be utilized for email marketing purposes. One common approach is to use AWS Lambda functions to handle email sending, AWS API Gateway to trigger these functions via HTTP requests, and AWS Simple Email Service (SES) to actually send the emails.
